# fpgaflash #

## SYNOPSIS ##
```console
fpgaflash [-h] {user,factory,factory_only,eeprom,bmc_bl,bmc_app,bmc_fw,bmc_img,bmc_factory,dtb} file [bdf]
```

## DESCRIPTION ##
`fpgaflash` updates both FPGA images and firmware in the flash memory device on Intel&reg; FPGAs. 

If there are multiple devices in the system, the `fpgaflash` command must specify a BDF to select the correct device. If you do not
speciy the BDF, `fpgaflash` prints out the BDFs of any compatible devices.

## POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS ##
`  {user,factory,factory_only,eeprom,bmc_bl,bmc_app,bmc_fw,bmc_img,bmc_factory,dtb}`

Some image types are not available for all PACs. The following table lists the image types and their availability. 

| Image type | Intel PAC Arria 10 GX FPGA | Intel PAC D50005 Stratix 10 FPGA| Usage |
| -----------|-------------------------  | -------------------------------- |--------------------- |
| `user`| Yes | Yes |  Only reprograms the user image in flash. |
| `factory` | Yes  | Yes | Reprograms the entire flash. A catastrophic failure during a factory update such as a power outage requires a USB cable and `quartus_pgm` to recover. |
| `factory_only` | No | Yes | Only updates the factory image in page 0.|
| `eeprom` | Yes | Yes |  EEPROM update. |
| `bmc_bl` | Yes | No | Intel FPGA PAC BMC boot loader update.|
| `bmc_app` | Yes | No | Intel FPGA PAC BMC application update. |
| `bmc_fw` | No | Yes | BMC firmware update. |
| `bmc_img` | No | Yes | BMC image update. |
| `bmc_factory`| No | Yes | BMC factory image update. |
| `dtb` | No | Yes | Updates the device tree data structure.|
 
## ADDTIONAL POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS ##

`file`

Specifies the Raw Programming Data File (rpd) to program into flash.

`bdf`

Specifies the bus, device and function (BDF) of device to program such as 04:00.0 or 0000:04:00.0. This flag
is optional when there is a single device in the system.


## OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS ##
`-h, --help`

`-n, --no-verify`
Do not read back flash and verify after writing.

`-y, --yes` 
Answer Yes to all confirmation prompts

## EXAMPLE ##

`fpgaflash user new_image.rpd 0000:04:00.0`

Programs `new_image.rpd` to flash of device with BDF 0000:04:00.0.
