## System compatibility ##

The OPAE SDK has been tested on the following configurations.

* Hardware: tightly coupled FPGA products and programmable FPGA acceleration 
  cards for Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; processors (to be released)
* Operating System: tested on RedHat 7.3, Linux kernels 3.10 through 4.7
* FIM (FPGA Interface Manager): 6.3.0

## How to download the OPAE SDK ##

OPAE SDK releases are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/OPAE/opae-sdk/releases). There, you can also find
the driver source code and DKMS packages for the respective SDK release.

The various componentes of OPAE are available via the following compressed tar files and RPM packages.

* Source packages

```console
opae-<release>.tar.gz                       (BSD License)   (all src for libopae-c, tools, samples, headers and ASE)
opae-sdk-<release>.tar.gz                   (BSD License)   (same as opae-<release>.tar.gz, generated by GitHub)
opae-intel-fpga-drv-<release>.tar.gz        (GPLv2 License) (driver sources)
```

* Binary packages (most can be built from source packages)

```console
opae-all-<release>-1.x86_64.rpm             (BSD License)   (meta-package for installing all dependent rpms)
opae-<release>-1.x86_64-libs.rpm            (BSD License)   (libopae-c bin)
opae-<release>-1.x86_64-tools.rpm           (BSD License)   (all tool bin files)
opae-<release>-1.x86_64-ase.rpm             (BSD License)   (ASE lib, ASE tools)
opae-<release>-1.x86_64-devel.rpm           (BSD License)   (header file for libopae-c and sample src file)
opae-intel-fpga-drv-<release>-1.x86_64.rpm  (GPLv2 License) (dkms and driver src to generate \*.ko at installation)
```

## Software requirements ##

For building the kernel driver, the kernel development environment is required.

## Driver installation with DKMS rpm package ##

Install:
```console
$ sudo yum install opae-intel-fpga-drv-<release>.rpm
```
Uninsall:
```console
$ sudo yum remove opae-intel-fpga-drv-<release>
```

During the rpm installation process, the tool will compile the driver from
source then install the driver automatically. Driver installed by rpm package
will be automatically install again after system reboot.

## Driver build/installation with driver source package ##

Using the following command to untar the source tar ball:

```console
$ tar zxvf opae-intel-fpga-driver-<release>.tar.gz
```

Following directory shall be extracted at the working directory where the above command is executed.

* `opae-intel-fpga-driver-<release>`

Build the fpga driver from source with following procedures:

```console
$ cd opae-intel-fpga-driver-<release>
$ make
```

Following kernel modules shall be generated from source:

* fpga-mgr-mod.ko
* intel-fpga-afu.ko
* intel-fpga-fme.ko
* intel-fpga-pci.ko

Install the above modules in the following order:

```console
$ sudo insmod fpga-mgr-mod.ko
$ sudo insmod intel-fpga-pci.ko
$ sudo insmod intel-fpga-fme.ko
$ sudo insmod intel-fpga-afu.ko
```

Use lsmod to check if all 4 modules are installed correctly or not:

```console
$ lsmod | grep fpga
```

Output should look like:

``` {.bash}

intel_fpga_fme         36864  0
intel_fpga_afu         28672  0
intel_fpga_pci         28672  2 intel_fpga_afu,intel_fpga_fme
fpga_mgr_mod           16384  1 intel_fpga_fme

```

Remove the driver modules in the following order:

```console
$ sudo rmmod intel-fpga-afu
$ sudo rmmod intel-fpga-fme
$ sudo rmmod intel-fpga-pci
$ sudo rmmod fpga-mgr-mod
```

## OPAE SDK installation with OPAE SDK rpm package ##
The libopae-c library, tools, headers, and the ASE library can be installed
using these commands:

```console
$ sudo yum install opae-<release>-1.x86_64-libs.rpm
$ sudo yum install opae-<release>-1.x86_64-tools.rpm
$ sudo yum install opae-<release>-1.x86_64-devel.rpm
$ sudo yum install opae-<release>-1.x86_64-ase.rpm
```

To uninstall:

```console
$ sudo yum remove opae-<release>-1.x86_64-libs
$ sudo yum remove opae-<release>-1.x86_64-tools
$ sudo yum remove opae-<release>-1.x86_64-devel
$ sudo yum remove opae-<release>-1.x86_64-ase
```

## OPAE SDK build/installation with OPAE SDK source package ##
Using the following command to untar the source tar ball:

```console
$ tar zxvf opae-sdk-<release>.tar.gz
```

Following directory shall be created at the working directory where the above command is executed.

* `opae-sdk-<release>`

Build the OPAE C library (libopae-c) and the AFU Simulation Environment (ASE)
library (libopae-c-ase) from source with following commands:

```console
$ cd opae-sdk-<release>
$ mkdir mybuild
$ cd mybuild
$ cmake .. -DBUILD_ASE=1
$ make
```

By default, the OPAE SDK will install into `/usr/local` if you also issue the following:

```console
    make install
```

You can change this installation prefix from `/usr/local` into something else
by adding `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<new prefix>` to the `cmake` command above.

Please see Quick Start Guide on how to run the hello\_fpga sample to verify
libopae-c & driver are built correctly.

## FPGA Device Access Permissions ##

Access to FPGA accelerators and devices is controlled using file access permissions on the 
Intel&reg; FPGA device files, `/dev/intel-fpga-fme.*` and `/dev/intel-fpga-port.*`, as well as to the files reachable through `/sys/class/fpga/`.

In order to allow regular (non-root) users to access accelerators, you need to grant them read and write permissions on `/dev/intel/fpga-port.*` (with `*` denoting the respective socket, i.e. 0 or 1). E.g.:

```console
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/inte-fpga-port.0
```

## Memlock limit ##

Depending on the requirements of your application, you may also want to
increase the maximum amount of memory a user process is allowed to lock. The
exact way to do this depends on your Linux distribution.

You can check the current memlock limit using

```console
$ ulimit -l
```

A way to permanently remove the limit for locked memory for a regular user is
to add the following lines to your /etc/security/limits.conf:

```console
user1    hard   memlock           unlimited
user1    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

This removes the limit on locked memory for user `user1`. To remove it for
all users, you can replace `user1` with `*`:

```console
*    hard   memlock           unlimited
*    soft   memlock           unlimited
```

## Hupgepage Settings ##

Users need to configure system hugepage to reserve 2MB-hugepages or
1GB-hugepages. For example, the 'hello\_fpga' sample requires several
2MB-hugepages. And the _fpgadiag_ tool requires several 1GB-hugepages.
    
The command below reserves 20 2M-hugepages: 

```
  $ sudo sh -c 'echo 20 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages'
```
The command below reserves 4 1GB-hugepages:
```
  $ sudo sh -c 'echo 4 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-1048576kB/nr_hugepages'
```

For x86\_64 architecture processors, user can use following command to find out avaiable hugepage sizes:
```
$ grep pse /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
flags : ... pse ...
```
If this commands returns a non-empty string, 2MB pages are supported.

```
$ grep pse /proc/cpuinfo | uniq
flags : ... pdpe1gb ...
```
If this commands returns a non-empty string, 1GB pages are supported.
